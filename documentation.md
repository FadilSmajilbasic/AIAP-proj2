## OpenCV

### What is it used for?
OpenCV stands for Open Computer Vision. It offers a very exhaustive framework for everything related to computer vision. OpenCV can be used for very basic tasks like opening an Image or a Video in a python project and editing these pictures. One option it offers, that will be used a lot is to greyscale an Image, since many of the other ressources provided with OpenCV require an image to be in greyscale. In our example we use OpenCV to detect a Face in an Image. This could be extended to use a Webcam and detect Faces in a livestream.

OpenCV includes a statistical machine learning library that contains:

- Boosting
- Decision tree learning
- Gradient boosting trees
- Expectation-maximization algorithm
- k-nearest neighbor algorithm
- Naive Bayes classifier
- Artificial neural networks
- Random forest
- Support vector machine (SVM)
- Deep neural networks (DNN)

### How do you use it
To use openCV you have to install it using: `pip install opencv-python`
And then import it in your python file using: `import cv2`

OpenCV can be used to display images, draw shapes over images (recangles, circles, lines, elippses, polygons, and text), apply filter to images (grayscale, color filter, blur,...)

Since videos are just a sequence of images, the same modifications can be done to videos as well.

### The Learning curve

### Developer adoption
OpenCV is well known to developers in general. The project initially released in June 2000 has since gained a lot of traction and
