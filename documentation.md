## OpenCV

### What is it used for?
OpenCV stands for Open Computer Vision. It offers a very exhaustive framework for everything related to computer vision. OpenCV can be used for very basic tasks like opening an Image or a Video in a python project and editing these pictures. One option it offers, that will be used a lot is to greyscale an Image, since many of the other ressources provided with OpenCV require an image to be in greyscale. In our example we use OpenCV to detect a Face in an Image. This could be extended to use a Webcam and detect Faces in a livestream.
